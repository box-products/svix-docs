title: Testing Events
---

The easiest way to be more confident in your endpoint configuation
is to start receiving events as quickly as possible.

That's why we we have a "Testing" tab for you to send example events
to your endpoint.

<img
  src="/img/app-portal/testing-endpoint.png"
  alt="testing-endpoint"
  width="50%"
  height="auto"
></img>

After sending an example event, you can click into the message to view
the message payload, all of the message attempts, and whether it
successed or failed.
